# Service Refactoring Summary

## Overview
Successfully reorganized the `app/Services` folder by renaming and moving files based on their functionality into appropriate folders with descriptive suffixes.

## Changes Made

### New Folder Structure
- `app/Managers/` - Classes that manage business logic and state
- `app/Processors/` - Classes that process data and calculations
- `app/Validators/` - Classes that validate input and business rules
- `app/Generators/` - Classes that generate data or random values
- `app/Loggers/` - Classes that handle logging functionality
- `app/Services/` - Main orchestrator services (GameEngine only)

### File Moves and Renames

#### Managers (Business Logic Management)
- `BonusService.php` → `app/Managers/BonusManager.php`
- `FreeSpinService.php` → `app/Managers/FreeSpinManager.php`
- `GameSessionService.php` → `app/Managers/GameSessionManager.php`
- `GameRoundService.php` → `app/Managers/GameRoundManager.php`
- `TransactionManager.php` → `app/Managers/TransactionManager.php`

#### Processors (Data Processing)
- `ScatterResultService.php` → `app/Processors/ScatterResultProcessor.php`
- `WildResultService.php` → `app/Processors/WildResultProcessor.php`

#### Validators (Input Validation)
- `BetValidator.php` → `app/Validators/BetValidator.php`

#### Generators (Data Generation)
- `RandomNumberGenerator.php` → `app/Generators/RandomNumberGenerator.php`
- `ReelGenerator.php` → `app/Generators/ReelGenerator.php`

#### Loggers (Logging)
- `GameLogger.php` → `app/Loggers/GameLogger.php`

### Updated References
- Updated all namespace declarations in moved files
- Updated class names where appropriate (Service → Manager/Processor)
- Updated dependency injection in constructors
- Updated service provider bindings in `AppServiceProvider.php`
- Updated controller dependencies and method calls
- Updated console command dependencies
- Updated test files and renamed test classes
- Updated steering documentation

### Files Updated
- `app/Http/Controllers/BonusController.php`
- `app/Http/Controllers/FreeSpinController.php`
- `app/Console/Commands/CleanupExpiredFreeSpins.php`
- `app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php`
- `app/Services/GameEngine.php`
- `app/Processors/PayoutProcessor.php`
- `tests/Unit/ScatterResultProcessorTest.php` (renamed)
- `tests/Unit/WildResultProcessorTest.php` (renamed)
- `.kiro/steering/structure.md`

## Benefits
1. **Better Organization**: Files are now grouped by their primary responsibility
2. **Clearer Naming**: Class names better reflect their actual functionality
3. **Improved Maintainability**: Easier to locate and understand code purpose
4. **SOLID Principles**: Better adherence to Single Responsibility Principle
5. **Scalability**: New classes can be easily categorized into appropriate folders

## Remaining Structure
The `app/Services` folder now only contains `GameEngine.php`, which serves as the main orchestrator and properly belongs in Services as it coordinates multiple other components.
