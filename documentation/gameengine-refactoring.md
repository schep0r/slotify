# GameEngine SOLID Refactoring

## Overview
The GameEngine has been refactored to follow SOLID principles by breaking down responsibilities into focused interfaces and implementations.

## SOLID Principles Applied

### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- **GameEngine**: Now only orchestrates the main game flow
- **ReelGenerator**: Handles reel position generation and symbol visibility
- **BetValidator**: Validates bets and user balance
- **PayoutCalculator**: Calculates game payouts
- **TransactionManager**: Manages financial transactions
- **GameLogger**: Handles game round logging

### Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
- All components are extensible through interfaces
- New implementations can be added without modifying existing code
- Game logic can be extended by implementing new interfaces

### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- All implementations can be substituted with their interfaces
- Interface contracts are properly maintained
- Behavior is consistent across implementations

### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- Each interface has a focused responsibility
- No interface forces implementation of unused methods
- Clean separation of concerns

### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
- GameEngine depends on abstractions (interfaces), not concretions
- All dependencies are injected through constructor
- Easy to mock and test individual components

## New Interfaces

### ReelGeneratorInterface
```php
- generateReelPositions(Game $game): array
- getVisibleSymbols(array $positions, Game $game): array
```

### BetValidatorInterface
```php
- validateBet(float $betAmount, Game $game): void
- validateBalance(User $user, float $betAmount): void
```

### PayoutCalculatorInterface
```php
- calculatePayout(Game $game, array $visibleSymbols, float $betAmount, array $activePaylines): array
```

### TransactionManagerInterface
```php
- processSpinTransaction(User $user, GameSession $gameSession, float $betAmount, array $payoutResult): float
```

### GameLoggerInterface
```php
- logGameRound(GameSession $gameSession, array $spinData, float $betAmount, array $visibleSymbols): void
```

## Benefits

1. **Testability**: Each component can be easily mocked and tested in isolation
2. **Maintainability**: Changes to one component don't affect others
3. **Extensibility**: New features can be added by implementing interfaces
4. **Readability**: Clear separation of concerns makes code easier to understand
5. **Flexibility**: Different implementations can be swapped easily

## Usage

The GameEngine now follows a clear 7-step process:

1. **Validate**: Bet amount and user balance
2. **Session**: Get or create game session
3. **Generate**: Reel positions and visible symbols
4. **Calculate**: Payouts and winnings
5. **Process**: Financial transactions
6. **Log**: Game round data
7. **Return**: Formatted game result

## Service Registration

All interfaces are registered in `AppServiceProvider` with their default implementations:

```php
$this->app->bind(ReelGeneratorInterface::class, ReelGenerator::class);
$this->app->bind(BetValidatorInterface::class, BetValidator::class);
// ... etc
```

This allows for easy swapping of implementations for testing or different game variants.
